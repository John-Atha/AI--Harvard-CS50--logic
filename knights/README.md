### Project 1a - Knight

* A simple implementation of the Knights and Knaves puzzle
* The code of the `logic.py` file was given as part of the distribution code.
* It uses the model-checking algorithm to solve the problem after testing all the possible <i>"worlds"</i>
* The aim was to complete the knowledge bases in each of the 4 puzzles given in natural language, so that the problem can be solved by the AI.
